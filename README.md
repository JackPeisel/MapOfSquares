# MapOfSquares

A game by Jack Peisel

MapOfSquares is a turn based strategy game. Each turn you get two moves. Moves can be used to move armies from square to square, or to build additional armies. Armies can be used to capture additional squares. Squares are the map unit of the game and may spawn additional armies at the start of every turn. Additionally at the start of each turn an event may occur, which can help or hurt the player.
